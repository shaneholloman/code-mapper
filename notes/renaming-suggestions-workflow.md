## Renaming Process

1. **Team Discussion**: Present the suggested names to the team and discuss the merits of each.

2. **Shortlist**: Narrow down to the top 3 choices based on team feedback.

3. **User Feedback**: If possible, get feedback from a small group of potential users on the shortlisted names.

4. **Final Decision**: Choose the final name based on team consensus and user feedback.

5. **Update Documentation**: Once a new name is chosen, update all relevant documentation, including:
   - README.md
   - Script comments
   - Any external documentation or references

6. **Repository Update**: If hosted on GitHub or a similar platform, update the repository name and description.

7. **Announcement**: If the tool has an existing user base, announce the name change through appropriate channels.

Remember, a good name should be:

- Descriptive of the tool's function
- Easy to remember and pronounce
- Unique enough to stand out
- Professional and appropriate for the target audience

Choose a name that best represents the tool's core functionality and appeals to your target users.
