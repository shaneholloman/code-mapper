## Overview

The Code Mapper is a powerful Python script that creates a comprehensive Markdown document representing the structure and contents of a given directory. This tool is designed to provide a quick and thorough overview of codebases, making it invaluable for developers, AI systems, and analysts who need to quickly understand the layout and content of a project.

## Features

- Generates a hierarchical table of contents based on file structure
- Creates an accurate file tree representation of the directory structure
- Produces code blocks for each file's contents with appropriate syntax highlighting
- Respects `.gitignore` rules when processing files and directories
- Excludes `.git` directories and archive files by default
- Supports various file types with appropriate code fence highlighting
- Handles file encoding detection for accurate content reading
- Provides an option to include files normally ignored by `.gitignore`

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- `pathspec` library (for handling `.gitignore` rules)
- `chardet` library (for file encoding detection)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/directory-structure-markdown-generator.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```sh
    pip install pathspec chardet
    ```

## Usage

Run the script from the command line, providing the path to the directory you want to analyze:

```python
python directory_markdown_generator.py <path_to_directory> [--include-ignored]
```

### Options

- `<path_to_directory>`: The path to the directory you want to analyze (required)
- `--include-ignored`: Include files that are normally ignored by `.gitignore` (optional)

## Output

The script generates a Markdown file named `<directory_name>_structure.md` in the current directory. This file contains:

1. A table of contents for easy navigation
2. A file tree representation of the directory structure
3. The contents of each file, formatted with appropriate syntax highlighting

Example output:

## Use Cases

- Quickly understand the structure of new or unfamiliar projects
- Generate documentation for your codebase
- Facilitate code reviews by providing a comprehensive overview
- Aid in onboarding new team members to a project
- Assist AI systems in analyzing and understanding codebases
